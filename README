# Shortest Path Finder

Python code to find the shortest path between two given points in the matrix


## Prerequisites

This code works with Python 3.6.0. It has a dependency on colorama module for python
If colorama is not installed, use "pip install colorama" for installing the package


## Running the code

usage: python shortestPathFinder.py [-h] [-d] [-p]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug         Debug mode
  -p, --print_result  Print shortest path in matrix

  
## Testscripts for shortest path finder 

usage: python matrixTest.py

Input files for the testscript is in json format covering the Matrix dimensions, matrix data 
and start and end points to traverse. The matrixTest.py script invokes shortestPathFinder to
validate whether the results are expected.
The json files are read from test folder.
